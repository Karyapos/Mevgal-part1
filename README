# **Mevgal Project – Part 1: Data Creation ,Understanding and Basic Analysis**

### **⚙️ Skills Used**

- **Excel**: Data cleaning, structure simulation, and return modeling (**focus**)
- **SQL**: Querying, filtering, and preparing datasets (**focus**)
- **Power BI**: Basic dashboard creation and metrics visualization
- **Realistic Scenario Modeling**: Built a complex simulation from real sales data using custom logistics, returns, and cost rules to reflect real-world challenges (**focus**)

## 📊 **Data**

The inspiration for this project came from a **real Mevgal sales dataset** covering **7 dairy products from 2020 to 2022**.

While the sales figures are **100% real**, everything else was created by me to simulate a realistic supply chain and distribution system.

---

### 🏭 **Production & Returns**

- Each product is produced using a **unique combination** of **Unit A** and **Unit B**.
- Each station returns **between 5% and 20%** of the product daily (randomized).
- Returned items are processed **at no cost** and reused **only in the same station** the next day.
- Returns are credited at **50% of the original selling price**.

---

### 🚚 **Distribution Constraints**

- **Each product must be delivered separately** due to specific temperature needs.
- **Station routes cannot be combined**, as the stations are located far from each other.
- **Truck capacity is limited to 100 units** per trip.
- **Distribution cost differs for each station**, simulating realistic delivery expenses.

## 📐 **Data Details**

This section presents key values used in the production simulation—specifically, the **product composition**, **cost calculations**, and the **suggested pricing strategy**.

### 🧪 **Product Composition & Costing**

| Product | Unit A | Unit B | Total Cost | Suggested Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product 1 | 1 | 2 | 1.60 | 2.33 |
| Product 2 | 1 | 1 | 1.15 | 2.08 |
| Product 3 | 2 | 1 | 1.85 | 2.82 |
| Product 4 | 1 | 3 | 2.05 | 2.97 |
| Product 5 | 3 | 0 | 2.10 | 3.11 |
| Product 6 | 2 | 2 | 2.30 | 3.04 |
| Product 7 | 1 | 2 | 1.60 | 2.43 |

### 🚛 **Truck Distribution Costs (per trip)**

| Station | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Station 1 | 35 |
| Station 2 | 40 |
| Station 3 | 45 |
| Station 4 | 35 |
| Station 5 | 50 |

## 🚀 **Preparing for Part 2**

The goal of this first phase was to build a full, realistic simulation environment.

Now that the model is in place, I'm moving into **Part 2**, where I will explore **four different strategic scenarios** aimed at:

1. **Advertisement Investment**
2. **Merchant Deal**
3. **Quality Reduction**
4. **Logistics Investment**
